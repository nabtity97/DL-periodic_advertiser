What I have added to this project? 
###################################
- Added the device name to the prj.conf CONFIG_BT_DEVICE_NAME="DL-Hesham", so we can configure the receiver to receive data only from this device
- started the avertising only once and commented out stoping advertising function, so we keep the device advertising forever.
